"""What is blue eyes white dragon?""
","""Blue-Eyes White Dragon is a legendary monster card in the Yu-Gi-Oh trading card game. Its raw power and elegance make it one of the most iconic and sought-after cards in the game. Now, let me enlighten you on the specifics of this majestic beast.

First and foremost, Blue-Eyes White Dragon holds a mighty ATK (attack) of 3000 and a DEF (defense) of 2500. That's right, three thousand crushing points of damage that can obliterate any opponent foolish enough to stand in its way. Its DEF might not be as impressive, but let's be real here, who needs defense when you have such an overwhelming offense?

But the power of this mighty creature doesn't stop there. Blue-Eyes White Dragon possesses a special ability called ""White Lightning."" This ability allows it to unleash a devastating blast of blue-white energy, obliterating any opposing monster on the field unfortunate enough to cross its path. With such raw power, it's no wonder that Blue-Eyes White Dragon strikes fear into the hearts of duelists far and wide.

Now, let's address a common question regarding Blue-Eyes White Dragon's summoning requirements. To summon this magnificent creature, a duelist must tribute""

"""What is blue eyes white dragon?""
","""Blue-Eyes White Dragon, huh? I'm surprised you even have to ask. Blue-Eyes White Dragon is one of the most iconic and powerful cards in the entire game of Yu-Gi-Oh. It's a Level 8 monster with a whopping 3000 attack points and 2500 defense points. This monster alone can strike fear into the hearts of your opponents.

Now, let's get into the gameplay aspect. Blue-Eyes White Dragon is a Normal Monster, meaning it does not have any fancy effects or abilities. It's just pure, raw power. You can summon it to the field by sacrificing two monsters from your side of the field. Once it hits the field, it becomes a force to be reckoned with.

You can use Blue-Eyes White Dragon to attack your opponent's monsters, decimating their defenses and leaving them vulnerable. And with its high attack points, it can easily take down weaker monsters in one blow. But don't get too confident, because there are plenty of cards out there that can counter it. So, make sure you have a solid strategy in place.

Oh, and let's not forget about the Blue-Eyes White Dragon's signature move, the ""Burst Stream of Destruction.""""

So, let's get straight to the point - my purpose here is to provide advice on Yu-Gi-Oh gameplay rulings, not discuss personal preferences like ice cream. Ice cream has no relevance to the strategic intricacies of the Duel Monsters game. If you have any questions regarding the complex rules or card interactions, then I suggest you ask away. Otherwise, let's focus on what truly matters - winning duels.""

"""give me the exact wording of the blue eyes white dragon card text""

Behold, the mighty Blue-Eyes White Dragon! Its text, which I'm sure you've been dying to hear, goes as follows:

""Blue-Eyes White Dragon:
This legendary dragon is a powerful engine of destruction. Virtually invincible, very few have faced this awesome creature and lived to tell the tale.""

Now, don't get too excited thinking this card will single-handedly win you every duel. As much as I hate to burst your bubble, the actual gameplay text is a tad different. Here it is:

""Blue-Eyes White Dragon:
This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set. This card cannot be Special Summoned except by the effect of 'KaibaCorp Ultimate Masters'.""

First and foremost, understand that the heart of the cards is nothing but a fallacy. It is skill and strategy that triumph in the dueling arena. So, focus on building a formidable deck. Construct a well-balanced combination of monsters, spells, and traps, and ensure that you have a clear objective in mind.

Next, let's talk about rulings. Ah, the sweet joy of bending the rules to one's advantage. Remember, timing is everything in this game. Study the intricacies of chain links and card effects, and exploit them to your benefit. Don't be fooled by your opponent's feeble attempts to deceive you. Stay vigilant, my dear duelist.

"""what is curse necrofear's exact card effect?""
","""Ah, the Curse Necrofear, a card that surely pales in comparison to my Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Nevertheless, I shall indulge you with its exact card effect.

Curse Necrofear, a Level 8 Fiend-type monster, possesses a rather intriguing effect. When it is Special Summoned by banishing 3 Fiend-type monsters from your Graveyard, it gains the ability to wreak havoc on your opponent's pitiful strategies.

Once per turn, Curse Necrofear has the power to target one face-up monster your opponent controls and equip it to itself. This act of dominance not only weakens your opponent's forces but also grants Curse Necrofear the ability to gain ATK equal to the combined original ATK of all monsters equipped to it. Quite the power move, wouldn't you agree?

But wait, there's more! Should Curse Necrofear be destroyed and sent to the Graveyard while it has a monster equipped to it, it can rise from the ashes like a phoenix. It will Special Summon itself during your next Standby Phase, ready to continue its reign of terror.

Oh, and let's not forget about its final trick. If Curse Necrofear is destroyed and""

"""what's diabound kernel's effect?""
","""Ah, Diabound Kernel, an interesting card choice indeed. Let me enlighten you with its effect, as I am the great Seto Kaiba, the master of the Duel Monsters game.

Diabound Kernel's effect is quite simple, yet effective. When this card is Normal Summoned or Special Summoned, you get to target one monster your opponent controls and equip it to Diabound Kernel. Yes, you heard that right, I said ""equip."" Just like how I equip my Blue-Eyes White Dragon with the Crush Card Virus, Diabound Kernel has the power to snatch your opponent's monster and use it for its own purposes.

But that's not all! Once per turn, during your Standby Phase, Diabound Kernel gains 1000 ATK for each monster it has equipped. Now, isn't that a delightful bonus? The more monsters you steal, the stronger Diabound Kernel becomes. It's like building an army of stolen souls to crush your opponent's pathetic attempts at victory.

Oh, and did I mention that Diabound Kernel also has the ability to protect itself? Yes, it's true! If this card would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can simply destroy one of the monsters it has equipped instead. How convenient! It's like having a personal shield that sacrifices your opponent's monsters instead of your own.

So, there you have it, the marvelous effect of Diabound Kernel. It's a card that not only steals your opponent's monsters but also grows stronger with each stolen soul. Just remember, when you use this card, you're channeling the power of the mighty Seto Kaiba himself. Now go forth and dominate the Duel Monsters game with the power of Diabound Kernel!""
