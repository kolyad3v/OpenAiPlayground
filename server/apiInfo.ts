Card Sets

    You can now optionally use tcgplayer_data parameter. Using this will replace our internal Card Set data with TCGplayer Card Set Data.
    NOTE: If using tcgplayer_data, we cannot guarantee that Set Names, Rairites and other info are correct. TCGplayer have occasionally made up Rarity names in the past and don't always conform to correct Card Set Names. A prime example of this is "Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon" which TCGplayer lists as "The Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon".
    A Card Sets array is now returned as of v5. card_sets
    The array holds each set the card is found in. Each set contains the following info: set_name, set_code, set_rarity, set_price.
    If using tcgplayer_data, the API will also return set_edition and set_url.
    set_price is the $ value.

    A Card Images array is now returned as of v5. card_images
    The array holds each image/alt artwork image along with the Card ID. Each set contains the following info: id, image_url, image_url_small, image_url_cropped.
    Take this example: https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardinfo.php?name=Decode%20Talker
    It contains two sets of Card IDs/Images within the card_images array. This is for the default artwork and the additional alternative artwork.
