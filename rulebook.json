Link Arrows - A Link Monster can apply its effects on cards or zones that its lit-up, red Link Arrows point to. When a Link Monster’s red arrow points to a monster, those monsters are “linked”. When two Link Monsters have red arrows that point at each other, they are “co-linked”. Link Materials - These are the Link Materials you need to Summon this Monster. Use this “recipe” printed here to Link Summon this monster. LINK Rating - This is the number of Link Arrows that monster has and the number of monsters needed to Summon it. Link Monsters have no DEF and cannot ever be in Defense Position. They can’t be changed to Defense Position by a card effect. They can’t even be flipped into face-down Defense Position. If your opponent has a monster in the Extra Monster Zone, it’s still a monster they control so you can’t attack directly. You have to battle and destroy all their monsters first, including the one in the Extra Monster Zone. If you take control of your opponent’s monster in the Extra Monster Zone, it moves to your Main Monster Zone. When it goes back to your opponent, it goes to their Main Monster Zone, not the Extra Monster Zone. As long as the materials meet the requirements of the Link Monster you want to Summon, you can use a Token or Trap Card that is treated as a monster as the Link Material. Remember that when you Link Summon, you need to meet 3 goals: The amount of materials you use matches the Link Rating (Link Monsters count as 1 OR their own Link Rating). The number of materials you use meets the number specified in the materials line or “recipe”. The materials match any other requirements in the materials line (such as only Effect Monsters, or only a specific Type of monster)."

If a player takes control of a card from their opponent, move it to the new controller’s side of the field. If sent to the Graveyard, or returned to the hand or Deck, it is always returned to the Graveyard / hand / Deck of the original owner."
	],
	"Destroy": [
		"A card is destroyed when it is sent to the Graveyard due to battle between monsters or by an effect that destroys a card. A card that is returned from the field to the hand or Deck, or, that is sent to the Graveyard as a cost or Tribute, is NOT considered “destroyed.”"
	],
	"Discard": [
		"Discard means to send a card from your hand to the Graveyard. This can happen because of a card effect or by adjusting the number of cards in your hand during the End Phase."
	],
	"Effects of Cards": [
		"The effect of a card is the special ability written on it, like the effect of a Spell, Trap, or Effect Monster. Costs that are needed to activate an ability are not part of the effect. The conditions that describe how to play a “Special Summon Monster” are also not an effect."
	],
	"Equip Cards": [
		"In addition to Equip Spell Cards, sometimes Trap Cards or Monster Cards can become equipped to a monster. Equipped Traps remain Trap Cards, but equipped monsters are considered to be Equip Spells. The term “Equip Card” includes all 3 kinds (standard Equip Spells, equipped Traps, and monsters equipped to other monsters). If a Monster Card is equipped to another monster, it remains equipped to that monster and cannot be moved to a different target, even by card effects that would normally be able to do so. EXCEPTION: Union monsters equipped by their own effects can be moved by appropriate card effects."
	],
	"Equipped Monster": [
		"A monster that is equipped with an Equip Card is an “equipped monster.” When this monster is destroyed or flipped face-down, the equipped card loses its target, and is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard."
	],
	"Excavate": [
		"When a card says to “excavate” cards from your Deck, you reveal those cards to both players. Then, before you do anything else, apply the instructions from the card effect that excavated them. Cards that are being excavated are still treated as being in the Deck until sent elsewhere by the card instructions."
	],
	"Original ATK (or DEF)": [
		"The Original ATK (or DEF) is the number of ATK (or DEF) points printed on the Monster Card. This does not include an increase from an Equip Spell Card or other card effect."
	],

	"Pay a Cost": [
		"To pay a cost is an action required by a player in order to activate a card, an effect, or to Summon a monster. Tributing to Tribute Summon a Level 5 monster is an example of a cost. Other common costs are discarding, paying LP, or banishing cards. You have to pay any costs before you declare the activation of the card. Even if the activation of the card is negated, you cannot get a refund of the cost that you have paid."
	],
	"piercingBattleDamage": [
		"Some monsters can inflict piercing battle damage when they attack a Defense Position monster. This means that you inflict damage to your opponent’s LP equal to the difference between the attacking monster’s ATK and the defending monster’s DEF."
	],
	"Random": [
		"When a card effect says to choose a card randomly, there is no official way of doing so, it is fine as long as neither player has a way of knowing which card is being chosen."
	],
	"Reveal": [
		"When an effect says to reveal a card, you show it to both players. You may have to reveal a face-down card, a card from your hand, or from the top of your Deck. Revealing a card does not activate the card or its Flip effect. Normally, revealed cards are returned to their original position after being looked at by both players."
	],
	"searchYourDeck": [
		"Whenever an effect instructs you to add a card from your Deck to your hand, or to Special Summon a monster from your Deck, you can pick up your Deck and search through it for the appropriate card. You must shuffle your Deck after any time you search it and let your opponent shuffle or cut. You cannot activate an effect to search your Deck for a card if there are no cards that meet the requirements in your Deck."
	],
	"sendToTheGraveYard": [
		"A card can be sent to the Graveyard in various ways. Destroying a card, discarding, and Tributing a monster are all actions that send a card to the Graveyard, and will normally activate “When this card is sent to the Graveyard…” Trigger Effects. EXCEPTION: When a banished card is moved to the Graveyard, it is not considered to be “sent to the Graveyard”."
	],
	"Set": [
		"Playing a card face-down is called a Set. For Monster Cards, playing it in face-down Defense Position is called a Set. Any card that is face-down on the field is a Set card."
	],
	"Shuffle": [
		"There is no rule for how to shuffle, but while shuffling you cannot look at the cards you are shuffling, or arrange the cards and then shuffle them."
	],
	"Tribute": [
		"Tributing is sending a monster you control to the Graveyard. You can Tribute a face-up or face-down monster, unless otherwise specified. Tributing a monster is one possible cost for Summoning a monster or activating an effect. A monster sent to the Graveyard by Tributing is not treated as “destroyed”."
