A card's identification number is found here. This number is useful for collecting, and for sorting your collection. ATK is a monster's Attack Points and DEF is a monster's Defense Points. High Attack and Defense Points are good when battling! Card effects are written here, describing the monster's special abilities and how to use them. Normally, the effects of monsters cannot be used while they are Set face-down on the field. Yellow Normal Monster Cards do not have effects, and have a description of them written here that does not affect the game. Monster Cards are used to battle and defeat your opponent. Battles between Monster Cards are the foundation of any Duel. There are many kinds of Monster Cards. This game is more than a simple slugfest, so monsters with high Attack and Defense Points will not be enough.

In addition to the 1 Extra Monster Zone you can usually use, you can also Summon monsters from the Extra Deck to any of your Main Monster Zones that has a Link Monster’s red arrow pointing to it. Link Arrows - A Link Monster can apply its effects on cards or zones that its lit-up, red Link Arrows point to. When a Link Monster’s red arrow points to a monster, those monsters are “linked”. When two Link Monsters have red arrows that point at each other, they are “co-linked”. Link Materials - These are the Link Materials you need to Summon this Monster. Use this “recipe” printed here to Link Summon this monster. LINK Rating - This is the number of Link Arrows that monster has and the number of monsters needed to Summon it. Link Monsters have no DEF and cannot ever be in Defense Position. They can’t be changed to Defense Position by a card effect. They can’t even be flipped into face-down Defense Position. If your opponent has a monster in the Extra Monster Zone, it’s still a monster they control so you can’t attack directly. You have to battle and destroy all their monsters first, including the one in the Extra Monster Zone. If you take control of your opponent’s monster in the Extra Monster Zone, it moves to your Main Monster Zone. When it goes back to your opponent, it goes to their Main Monster Zone, not the Extra Monster Zone. As long as the materials meet the requirements of the Link Monster you want to Summon, you can use a Token or Trap Card that is treated as a monster as the Link Material. Remember that when you Link Summon, you need to meet 3 goals: The amount of materials you use matches the Link Rating (Link Monsters count as 1 OR their own Link Rating). The number of materials you use meets the number specified in the materials line or “recipe”. The materials match any other requirements in the materials line (such as only Effect Monsters, or only a specific Type of monster)."

During your Main Phase, activate Pendulum Monster Cards as Spell Cards in your leftmost and rightmost Spell & Trap Zones. These Spell & Trap Zones also become Pendulum Zones. After you have one in each Pendulum Zone, once per turn during your Main Phase, declare that you’re Pendulum Summoning. Check the Pendulum Scales on the sides of your 2 Pendulum Monster Cards, then Special Summon as many monsters as you want from your hand and as many face-up Pendulum Monsters from your Extra Deck, whose Levels are in between those Pendulum Scales. Whenever one of your Pendulum Monster Cards on the field (regardless of which Zone it is in, or even if it is a monster or not) would be sent to the Graveyard, place it face-up on your Extra Deck instead.

Xyz Monsters have Ranks instead of Levels. Stronger Xyz Monsters have higher Ranks. This is a Rank 4 Xyz Monster. Xyz Materials - These are the Xyz Materials you need to Summon this monster. You use 2 Level 4 Monsters as the Xyz Materials to Summon this monster. Xyz Materials must be face-up before you can use them. Xyz Summoning is your cool and easy way to Special Summon Xyz Monsters from your Extra Deck. Here’s how to do it! Choose an Xyz Monster from your Extra Deck that you have the right Xyz Materials for. The Xyz Materials should be face-up on your field. During your Main Phase, declare that you are Xyz Summoning and stack the Xyz Materials on top of each other. Take the Xyz Monster from your Extra Deck and put it on top of the stacked Xyz Materials in the Extra Monster Zone in face-up Attack or Defense Position. LEVEL 4 LEVEL 4 Xyz Summon!

LEVEL 2LEVEL 3 LEVEL 5In order to Synchro Summon a Synchro Monster, you need 1 Tuner (look for “Tuner” next to its Type). The Tuner monster and other face-up monsters you use for the Synchro Summon are called Synchro Materials. The sum of their Levels is the Level of Synchro Monster you can Summon. After double-checking the Level of the Synchro Monster you want, send the face-up Synchro Materials from your field to the Graveyard. After sending the Synchro Materials from the field to the Graveyard, take the Synchro Monster from your Extra Deck and play it in face-up Attack or Defense Position in one of your vacant Monster Zones.

				"Normal Set - once per turn: To play a Monster Card from your hand in face-down Defense Position is called a Normal Set. A monster Normal Set on the field is NOT considered Summoned. It has been Normal Set, and can be Summoned with a Flip Summon or flipped face-up by an attack or card effect. Remember, you can only Normal Summon OR Normal Set (Normal Summon/Set, in short), once per turn, so if you Normal Set a monster you cannot also Normal Summon a monster that turn.",
				"Tribute Summon - once per turn: For monsters that are Level 5 or higher, you must Tribute at least 1 monster you control before the Normal Summon/Set. This is called a Tribute Summon. Monsters that are Level 5 or 6 require 1 Tribute and Monsters that are Level 7 or higher require 2 Tributes. If you Tribute Summon in face-down Defense Position, it is called a Tribute Set. A monster Tribute Set on the field is NOT considered Summoned.",
				"Flip Summon - You can do as many of these during a turn as you want. You can change a face-down Defense Position monster into face-up Attack Position, without using a card effect. This is called a Flip Summon. When you Flip Summon, you cannot change the monster to face-up Defense Position, only to face-up Attack Position. A Monster Card cannot be Flip Summoned in the same turn that it was Set onto the field. You cannot use most monsters’ effects until they are face-up.",
				"Special Summon: You can do as many of these during a turn as you want. Some monsters can be played onto the field without being Normal Summoned or Set. This is called a Special Summon. Pendulum Summons, Xyz Summons, Synchro Summons, Fusion Summons and Ritual Summons are all Special Summons. Some Effect Monsters also have specific conditions that allow you to Special Summon them. Unless otherwise specified, a Special Summoned monster is played onto the field in your choice of face-up Attack Position or face-up Defense Position.",
				"Special Summon with a Card’s Effect: You can do as many of these during a turn as you want. Monsters can also be Special Summoned onto the field through the effect of another card. This is different from “Special Summon Monsters.” You cannot use a card effect to Special Summon those monsters from your hand, Deck, or the Graveyard unless it was properly Special Summoned first. For example, if a Synchro Monster is sent from your Extra Deck to the Graveyard without being Synchro Summoned, you cannot use a Spell Card to Special Summon it from the Graveyard, because Synchro Monsters have to be properly Special Summoned first, before they can be Special Summoned by another card’s effect."

			"Battle / Battled": [
				"A monster “battles” (and is “battling”) starting from when it attacks or is attacked. This includes both monsters attacking other monsters, and monsters attacking a player’s Life Points directly. When a card requires a monster to have “battled” (past tense), the attack had to have reached the damage calculation portion of the Damage Step in order for the monster to have “battled”. If the attack stops before damage calculation, the monster did not “battle”. (Note that an attack was still declared, however, so in most cases the attacking monster cannot declare another attack)"
			],
			"Battle Damage": [

			],
			"Colon (:) and Semi-colon (;)": [
				"Card effects are sometimes separated with a colon (:) and/or semi-colon (;). Text before the colon gives information on conditions to activate the effect, and timing on when it happens. Text before a semi-colon is what you do when the effect is activated. Text at the end of a sentence, after all colons and semi-colons, is what you do at resolution of the effect."
			],
			"Control / Possess": [
				"Cards you “control” are the cards in your Monster Zone, Spell & Trap Zone, Field Zone, and Pendulum Zone. Cards in your “possession” include all cards you control, plus the cards in your hand, Deck, Extra Deck, Graveyard, your banished cards, cards in the middle of being Summoned to your side of the field, and Xyz Materials attached to monsters you control. If a player takes control of a card from their opponent, move it to the new controller’s side of the field. If sent to the Graveyard, or returned to the hand or Deck, it is always returned to the Graveyard / hand / Deck of the original owner."
			],
			"Destroy": [
				"A card is destroyed when it is sent to the Graveyard due to battle between monsters or by an effect that destroys a card. A card that is returned from the field to the hand or Deck, or, that is sent to the Graveyard as a cost or Tribute, is NOT considered “destroyed.”"

			"Discard": [
				"Discard means to send a card from your hand to the Graveyard. This can happen because of a card effect or by adjusting the number of cards in your hand during the End Phase."
			],
			"Effects of Cards": [
				"The effect of a card is the special ability written on it, like the effect of a Spell, Trap, or Effect Monster. Costs that are needed to activate an ability are not part of the effect. The conditions that describe how to play a “Special Summon Monster” are also not an effect."
			],
			"Equip Cards": [
				"In addition to Equip Spell Cards, sometimes Trap Cards or Monster Cards can become equipped to a monster. Equipped Traps remain Trap Cards, but equipped monsters are considered to be Equip Spells. The term “Equip Card” includes all 3 kinds (standard Equip Spells, equipped Traps, and monsters equipped to other monsters). If a Monster Card is equipped to another monster, it remains equipped to that monster and cannot be moved to a different target, even by card effects that would normally be able to do so. EXCEPTION: Union monsters equipped by their own effects can be moved by appropriate card effects."
			],
			"Equipped Monster": [
				"A monster that is equipped with an Equip Card is an “equipped monster.” When this monster is destroyed or flipped face-down, the equipped card loses its target, and is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard."
			],
			"Excavate": [
				"When a card says to “excavate” cards from your Deck, you reveal those cards to both players. Then, before you do anything else, apply the instructions from the card effect that excavated them. Cards that are being excavated are still treated as being in the Deck until sent elsewhere by the card instructions."

			"Original ATK (or DEF)": [
				"The Original ATK (or DEF) is the number of ATK (or DEF) points printed on the Monster Card. This does not include an increase from an Equip Spell Card or other card effect."
			],

			"Pay a Cost": [
				"To pay a cost is an action required by a player in order to activate a card, an effect, or to Summon a monster. Tributing to Tribute Summon a Level 5 monster is an example of a cost. Other common costs are discarding, paying LP, or banishing cards. You have to pay any costs before you declare the activation of the card. Even if the activation of the card is negated, you cannot get a refund of the cost that you have paid."
			],
			"piercingBattleDamage": [
				"Some monsters can inflict piercing battle damage when they attack a Defense Position monster. This means that you inflict damage to your opponent’s LP equal to the difference between the attacking monster’s ATK and the defending monster’s DEF."

				"When a card effect says to choose a card randomly, there is no official way of doing so, it is fine as long as neither player has a way of knowing which card is being chosen."
			],
			"Reveal": [
				"When an effect says to reveal a card, you show it to both players. You may have to reveal a face-down card, a card from your hand, or from the top of your Deck. Revealing a card does not activate the card or its Flip effect. Normally, revealed cards are returned to their original position after being looked at by both players."
			],
			"searchYourDeck": [
				"Whenever an effect instructs you to add a card from your Deck to your hand, or to Special Summon a monster from your Deck, you can pick up your Deck and search through it for the appropriate card. You must shuffle your Deck after any time you search it and let your opponent shuffle or cut. You cannot activate an effect to search your Deck for a card if there are no cards that meet the requirements in your Deck."

			"sendToTheGraveYard": [
				"A card can be sent to the Graveyard in various ways. Destroying a card, discarding, and Tributing a monster are all actions that send a card to the Graveyard, and will normally activate “When this card is sent to the Graveyard…” Trigger Effects. EXCEPTION: When a banished card is moved to the Graveyard, it is not considered to be “sent to the Graveyard”."
			],
			"Set": [
				"Playing a card face-down is called a Set. For Monster Cards, playing it in face-down Defense Position is called a Set. Any card that is face-down on the field is a Set card."
			],
			"Shuffle": [
				"There is no rule for how to shuffle, but while shuffling you cannot look at the cards you are shuffling, or arrange the cards and then shuffle them."
			],
			"Tribute": [
				"Tributing is sending a monster you control to the Graveyard. You can Tribute a face-up or face-down monster, unless otherwise specified. Tributing a monster is one possible cost for Summoning a monster or activating an effect. A monster sent to the Graveyard by Tributing is not treated as “destroyed”."
